# frozen_string_literal: true

# Basic logic
# - This problem can be solved with simple iteration and condition evaluation.
#   - Loop to increment the provided number by 1, returning the current number
#     when all of the following number properties are true (check after
#     increment):
#     - Odd
#     - Multiple of 7
#     - All digits are unique
#   - Raise an exception if the number >= 9,999,999,999
