# frozen_string_literal: true

# Basic logic:
# Given an odd number:
# - Print 3 asterisks that are separated by two spaces of equal length.
# - Repeat until there are no spaces:
#   - Reduce space size by 1, printing centered content within a length equal
#     to number.
# - Print asterisks equal to number.
# - Reverse the process.
#   - Create a method that can print outside-in or inside-out (reverse).
